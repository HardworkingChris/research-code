PERSONAL CODE REPOSITORY
========================

This is the personal code repository of Achilleas Koutsou.
Most code contained in this repository is licensed under the Apache License v2.0 unless otherwise stated.

WARNING: This repository is usually a mess. There is very little attempt to have any logical or functional structure. In the near future, it will most likely be split into multiple repositories, based on separate projects. More importantly, spikerlib will most likely become a separate python module and will have its own repository.
